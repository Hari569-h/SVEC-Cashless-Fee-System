# Blockchain Integration Notes

## Overview
The system now automatically verifies transactions on the blockchain without requiring manual intervention. When a payment is processed, it's automatically stored in Firebase and registered on the blockchain simulation.

## Implementation Details

1. **Automatic Verification Process**:
   - When a payment is processed, blockchain verification happens automatically
   - The system uses Bitquery to simulate blockchain transactions
   - A success message is displayed after verification

2. **Firebase Collections**:
   The system uses two Firebase collections to store blockchain data:
   - `blockchain_verifications`: Stores successful verifications
   - `blockchain_verification_failures`: Stores failed verification attempts

3. **Data Stored in Blockchain Verifications**:
   - Transaction ID
   - Student details (ID, name)
   - Payment details (amount, method, receipt number)
   - Blockchain reference (transaction hash)
   - Block number
   - Network (polygon)
   - Verification timestamp
   - Verifier information

4. **Receipt Integration**:
   - Receipts now include blockchain verification data
   - Each receipt displays the transaction hash and block number
   - PDF receipts include a special blockchain verification section
   - Text receipts include a dedicated blockchain verification block
   - Receipts are regenerated after blockchain verification to include this data

## Technical Notes

1. The blockchain verification is simulated using the Polygon network for testing
2. Actual blockchain integration can be implemented by extending the BitqueryClient class in bitquery.js
3. The API key (w313LcJiCi-yGVE6JiaZp3qWSg) used for Bitquery is already integrated

## Troubleshooting

If blockchain verifications aren't appearing in Firebase:
1. Check that the Firebase collections exist (`blockchain_verifications` and `blockchain_verification_failures`)
2. These collections are created automatically when the first transaction is processed
3. Ensure the BitqueryClient is properly loaded (bitquery.js is included in staff_dashboard.html)
4. Verify that the payment was processed successfully
